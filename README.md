## About Me

My name is Ben Storlie, transitioning from a rewarding career as a Special Education Paraprofessional to pursue my enthusiasm for development. With five years of experience supporting diverse learners, I am well-versed in creative, resourceful problem-solving, and I prioritize accessiblity and inclusion. I would be thrilled for an opportunity to contribute toward assistive technology.

I recently completed a Coding Boot Camp at the University of California - Davis, specializing in full stack web development with JavaScript. Many of my projects showcased on Github originated from boot camp assignments or collaborations.

Currently, I am exploring TypeScript, and I'm looking to get experience in strict typed languages like C++. See [@pocketsquest](https://github.com/pocketsquest) for my casual or just-for-fun projects.

I'm open to work! I am eager to collaborate, broaden my experience, and continue to learn new things!
